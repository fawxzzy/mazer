# Mazer Install Decision Matrix

## Summary recommendation

Use this matrix to choose only one new lane at a time.

- Baseline now: browser/PWA + Edge app install + repo launcher scripts.
- Best next desktop lane: Tauri.
- Best next true mobile lane: Capacitor.
- Best Android-fast lane: TWA/Bubblewrap.
- Roku: separate product, not a packaging increment.

## Comparison matrix

| Lane | Implementation effort | Web code reuse | Windows | macOS | Linux | Android | iPhone / iPad | TV / Roku | App store viability | Update story | Install UX quality | Pin / home screen behavior | Signing / packaging overhead | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Browser / PWA install flow | Low, already shipped | Very high | Good in Chromium | Fair in Chromium | Fair in Chromium | Good in Chromium | Manual Safari flow only | Weak | None directly, except possible PWA-store packaging later | Web deploy + service worker behavior | Variable, browser-controlled | Desktop app icon where supported; Android home screen; manual iOS Home Screen | Low | Keep as baseline |
| Edge install site as app | Low, already operational | Very high | Very good | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | No | No direct store lane | Browser/web updates | Good for Windows personal use | Taskbar pin, Start, desktop shortcut, auto-start via `edge://apps` | Very low | Keep on Windows now |
| PWABuilder Windows package / Microsoft Store | Moderate | Very high | Strong | No | No | No | No | No | Strong for Microsoft Store | Web code updates usually flow from web; manifest-integrated changes need repackage/resubmit | Good | Start/taskbar integration as packaged Windows app | Moderate | Use only if Windows package/store matters |
| Tauri desktop app | Moderate to high | High | Strong | Strong | Strong | Possible via Tauri mobile, but not the best immediate lane | Possible via Tauri mobile, but not the best immediate lane | No | Direct download strong; desktop store possible with more work | Tauri updater or store flow; release engineering required | Strong | Native app pinning / desktop integration | High | Best next desktop lane |
| Electron desktop app | Moderate to high | High | Strong | Strong | Strong | No practical win for this product | No practical win for this product | No | Direct download strong; desktop store possible | Mature auto-update paths on Win/macOS; Linux usually package-manager oriented | Strong | Native app pinning / desktop integration | High | Only if Electron ecosystem is specifically needed |
| Capacitor mobile app | Moderate to high | High | No primary value | No primary value | No | Strong | Strong | No | Strong for Play Store and App Store | Store release by default; Live Updates possible for web-layer changes with extra tooling | Strong once polished | Android launcher + iOS Home Screen app identity | High | Best true mobile lane later |
| Android TWA / Bubblewrap / PWABuilder | Moderate | Very high | No | No | No | Strong | No | No | Strong for Google Play | Web app updates for the site; wrapper updates when native metadata or wrapper changes | Good on Android | Android launcher install via Play / TWA | Moderate | Best if Android-only speed matters |
| Roku-native app | High | Low to moderate | No | No | No | No | No | Strong only on Roku | Roku channel distribution only | Separate Roku app releases | Can be strong if built well | Roku home screen / channel install | High and separate stack | Defer unless Roku becomes explicit scope |

## Detailed scoring notes

### Browser / PWA install flow

- Effort: low because Mazer already ships it.
- Reuse: near-total reuse.
- Risk: platform inconsistency, not engineering instability.
- Fit: strongest current value-per-hour lane.

### Edge app lane

- Effort: low because repo launchers already shape the URL and shortcut flow.
- Reuse: total reuse.
- Risk: browser-owned experience, not a controlled installer.
- Fit: strongest current Windows quality-of-life lane.

### PWABuilder Windows package

- Effort: moderate because packaging metadata, Partner Center setup, and package testing are still required.
- Reuse: almost total reuse.
- Risk: Windows-only lane and more packaging bureaucracy than the current need may justify.
- Fit: useful if Windows storefront presence matters.

### Tauri

- Effort: moderate to high because the repo would gain a Rust/native release lane.
- Reuse: strong for the existing web presentation.
- Risk: packaging/signing complexity, not runtime fit.
- Fit: best choice when "installer we own" becomes the actual problem.

### Electron

- Effort: similar to Tauri in setup class, often heavier in ongoing footprint.
- Reuse: strong.
- Risk: bigger runtime and more package weight than Mazer seems to need.
- Fit: only if Electron-specific integrations become important.

### Capacitor

- Effort: moderate to high because mobile product QA is real work even with high code reuse.
- Reuse: strong for web code, weaker for UX assumptions.
- Risk: mobile shell and store obligations arrive immediately.
- Fit: best if Mazer needs real mobile-app distribution.

### TWA / Bubblewrap

- Effort: lower than Capacitor for Android-only shipping.
- Reuse: near-total reuse.
- Risk: Android-only, asset-links verification, narrower native extensibility.
- Fit: best if the real ask is "get the web app into Play quickly."

### Roku-native

- Effort: high because this is a separate platform stack.
- Reuse: mostly conceptual, not implementation-level.
- Risk: high scope expansion.
- Fit: only for an explicit Roku product.

## Current Mazer-specific call

If I score these lanes against the current repo state, the ranking is:

1. Keep browser/PWA + Edge launcher as-is.
2. Tauri if a real desktop installer becomes necessary.
3. Capacitor if mobile-store presence becomes necessary.
4. TWA/Bubblewrap if Android-only speed becomes necessary.
5. PWABuilder Windows package if Microsoft Store visibility becomes necessary.
6. Electron only for a desktop-integration reason that Tauri does not satisfy.
7. Roku-native only as a separate product decision.
