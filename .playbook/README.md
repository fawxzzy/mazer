# `.playbook` Boundary

This folder is the repo-local coordination surface for narrow playbook notes and lane-specific guidance.

- `PLAYBOOK.md` remains the canonical rebuild-principles note for this repo.
- `playbook.config.json` activates the repo-local Playbook install surface.
- `npm run verify:local` is the local verification gate Playbook should use for this repo.
- `.playbook/` does not own product truth, runtime contracts, or gameplay behavior.
- Current repo truth stays with the active source tree, `docs/current-truth.md`, repo-owned visual evidence, and live tests.
- The active product lane is the 2D Phaser shipping runtime.
- `src/future-runtime/**`, `planet3d.html`, and rotating-planet research remain future-facing and deferred unless a later lane explicitly reopens them.

Keep notes here small and boundary-focused. Do not use `.playbook/` to override source, test, or release truth.
